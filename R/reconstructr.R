#'@title functions for session reconstruction and analysis
#'@description
#'sessionreconstruct provides functions to aid in reconstructing and analysing user sessions.
#'Although primarily designed for web sessions (see the 'session reconstruction methodology' vignette), its session
#'approach is plausibly applicable to other domains, and the
#'analytical functions also provided in the package should be generalisable.
