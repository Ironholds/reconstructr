Within web analytics, session reconstruction is an essential prerequisite of a host of useful and commonly-requested
metrics, including time-on-site, time-on-page, and bounce rate. What approach to session reconstruction works best
is hotly debated, despite two decades of research in the field. This vignette described some of the most
commonly-used approaches, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and after arguing for *heuristic reconstruction*
as the most common and scientifically supported approach, demonstrates the proper use of <code>reconstructr</code>
to reconstruct sessions using this methodology.
