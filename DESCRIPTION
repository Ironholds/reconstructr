Description: sessionreconstruct provides functions to aid in reconstructing and
    analysing user sessions. Although primarily designed for web sessions (see
    the 'session reconstruction methodology' vignette), its
    approach is plausibly applicable to other domains, and the
    analytical functions also provided in the package should be generalisable.
