Description: This library provides functions to aid in reconstructing sessions
    and efficiently calculating an array of metrics from the resulting data,
    including bounce rate, time-on-page, and session length. Although primarily
    designed for web data and analytics, its approach is plausibly applicable
    to other domains, and the analytical functions provides in the package
    should be generalisable.
